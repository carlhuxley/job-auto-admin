# job-auto-admin
This code is automating some of the admin tasks of finding a job. For instance using Selenium and PyAutoGUI it uploads CVs to cv-library.co.uk.
I'm working on a method that adds template cover letters to the Create New Cover Letter location in cv-library.
I want to move some of the change_cover_letters method functionality currently in cvlib_auto.py into the User class in auto_web.py so the Webdriver ActionChains can be used more flexibly.
